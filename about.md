Hi there; I'm Alex.

Currently I work at MenuTrinfo; we provide menu analysis for menus, food safety
training for restaurants, and alergen free certifications for kitchens.  Uniquely,
our office runs primarly in an Ubuntu linux desktop environment.  My work focuses
around enabling the team members by updaing the existing python code base, setting
up and deploying new desktops and servers, and creating new tools and functions
to make others work easier and more efficient.

Previous to MenuTrinfo I was employed at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.  I started
in 2015 and managed HPE's internal Debian and CoreOS derivatives, from creation
to deployment.

Most of my programing experience is self taught along side work projects.  Most
recently creating an API for managing and taking multiple choice tests.  Other
self driven projects including writing a discord bot that presents data and
analytics taken from public API's, and studying betting strategies for a few
different casino games.

When I'm not writing code behind a computer, I do Live Action Role Play (LARP)
with a group called Amtgard.  I have held various administrative and support
positions to run the local organization.  This helps lead to other fun hobbies
such as staying fit, sewing, and other types of crafting.
