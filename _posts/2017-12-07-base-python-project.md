title: Base Python Project
---

Between work and personal projects I've found that have been creating new python 
projects left, right, and center.  Every time it's the same thing!  Make a 
directory for the project, and add \_\_main__ and \_\_init__ files.  Then you have 
to create some kind of version and user tracking for the project.  Create a 
setup.py and point it at whatever code launches it.  Figure out the requirements 
and add them to a requirements file.  Don't forget about readme's and TODO's. 
Long story short: it gets tiresome and do the same process over and over again. 

Copy and paste is our friend here, but it doesnt make sense to copy an entire 
poject and delete all the code.  It's almost just as bad as creating a new 
project.  

For this, I created a shell for my python projects on git.  Shell projects are 
nothing new, but I don't think I've seen on for a python project.  It's really 
made project creation much faster and easier, and while not every project is 
the same, it's much easier to make a few changes to an existing shell, than to 
create one from scratch.  Now new projects are as easy as cloning the repo and 
renaming it.  Then it's a simple matter of adding some contact info and naming 
the project.
